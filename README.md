# Cybersecurity Learning Update: Understanding Risk, Assets & Encryption

This update documents my learning on essential cybersecurity principles, including asset management, risk assessment, and encryption techniques—key foundations in securing digital environments.

---

##  Key Concepts

###  Definitions
- **Asset**: Anything of value to an organization.
- **Threat**: An event that could harm an asset.
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

These three elements form the core of any effective security strategy.

---

##  Asset Classification
- **Public**
- **Internal Only**
- **Confidential**
- **Restricted**

---

##  Data States
Data must be protected in all three of its states:
- **In Use**
- **In Transit**
- **At Rest**

---

##  Understanding Risk
Risk can impact the **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, or **Availability** of an asset (CIA Triad). It can appear as:
- Damage
- Disclosure
- Loss of Information

---

##  NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
A voluntary framework to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.

- **Core**: Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover  
- **Tiers**: Maturity levels (Tier 1 – Tier 4)  
- **Profile**: Compares current and target states of security efforts  

---

##  Encryption Methods

- **Symmetric Encryption**  
  Uses one shared secret key for both encryption and decryption.

- **Asymmetric Encryption**  
  Uses a public and a private key for secure communication.

---

##  Vulnerability Assessment

Steps to identify and fix security weaknesses:
1. **Identification**
2. **Vulnerability Analysis**
3. **Risk Assessment**
4. **Remediation**

Each lesson strengthens my understanding of cybersecurity, bringing me one step closer to becoming a well-rounded professional.
